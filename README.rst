Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Three types of users exist that can be created. The admin, teacher and student. The final one is the director but this cannot be created normally but is created only at the start of the project as a superuser.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your admin user logged in on Chrome and your teacher user logged in on Firefox (or similar) interchangeably, so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.
